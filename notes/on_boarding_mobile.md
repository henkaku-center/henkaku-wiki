	- **Get some MATIC**  
	When sending tokens on the blockchain, you need to pay a transaction fee called "gas fees". You will need some $MATIC to send HENKAKU tokens ($HENKAKU) in the Polygon network. If you don't have $MATIC, you can get $MATIC from Admin by following the procedure below.     
	  - **Tap the channel "❓｜q-and-a"**  
	  - Copy and paste "INITIAL \$MATIC needed" into message area in the bottom (but do not post).  
	  - Copy your address from your wallet and paste followed by ". .needed”.  
		(You can copy your address "0x............" from your MetaMask wallet).  
	  - When you post, Admin will send some $MATIC to your wallet. You can check your $MATIC in MetaMask. It's a very small amount, but if you're just sending $HENKAKU in this community, it's no problem at all.  
	- **How to use $HENKAKU**。
	  - **Tap the channel "💰│henkaku-exchange"**  
	  - Post the command "!register".
	  - When you receive a DM from coinvise Bot, copy the link in the DM.  
	  - Set your MetaMask wallet to Polygon Mainnet.
	  - Open the MetaMask browser and paste the URL where it shows "Search or Type URL", and open it.  
		(Tap the "≡" button in the upper left corner and select Browser to open the browser.)   
	  - Tap on "connect to Metamask"  
	  - Tap on "Veryfy using MetaMask"  
	  - Tap "Sign", and then "Registration Complete" is displyed.
